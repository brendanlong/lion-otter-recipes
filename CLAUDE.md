- Commit after finishing fixes or features
- Prefer to amend if fixing the current commit
- ALWAYS check the current commit before amending
- Reference @docs/architecture.d2 and keep it up to date with any changes
- Before committing, always run the CI checks locally to verify nothing is broken:
  - `./gradlew assembleDebug` (debug build)
  - `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` (unit tests)
  - `./gradlew lintDebug` (lint)
  - See `.github/workflows/android-ci.yml` for the full CI pipeline
